                    <p>Have you ever felt compelled to save a dog after seeing
                    their shelter photo online? This poor dog was abandoned
                    at a local shelter by his owners ...

                    <p>Chewing on dog chew bones or hard toys helps scrape
                        away plaque, which can cause bad breath and a number of
                        potentially serioous dental problems. The action of 
                        the bone against the teeth scrapes away plaque and controls
                        tartar buildup - helping prevent periodontal disease and
                        yellowing of teeth.

                    <p>We have five dogs. We enjoy them immensely. We volunteer
                        at a local animal welfare organization. Over the years, 
                        I have come to realize that well-meaning humans
                        unknowingly mistreat, endanger and hurt their dogs
                        every day. We see the results at the shelter.

                        A dog-friendly office optimises opportunities for exercise, giving pet owners an excuse to get out of the office and fit in a walk on their lunchbreak. Research has suggested that remaining seated for too long is bad for your health, and could be linked to being overweight and obese, type 2 diabetes, some types of cancer, and premature death. Many adults in the UK spend more than seven hours a day sitting or lying - which is why it is important to take regular breaks from your desk to keep active. A dog is a constant reminder to get up, stretch your legs and take a brief pause from your screen.

                    Dogs really do deserve their title of 'man's best friend'. They're loyal, intelligent, devoted and affectionate â€" and are known to improve our physical and mental health. When it comes to deciding which dogs make the best pets, it really does depend on your lifestyle and the environment you live in.
